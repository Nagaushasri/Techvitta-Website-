that decentralized digital money was possible.</p>\r\n\r\n      <h3>2013-2014: Ethereum and Smart Contracts</h3>\r\n      <p>Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum brought programmability to blockchain, enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).</p>\r\n\r\n      <h3>2017: The ICO Boom</h3>\r\n      <p>Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) demonstrated new ways to fund projects and distribute

network</li>\r\n        <li><strong>User Ownership:</strong> Users own their data and digital assets</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Trustlessness:</strong> Interactions don't require trust in intermediaries</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Open-source code and public ledgers</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Different systems can work together seamlessly</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Current State of Web3</h2>\r\n      <p>Today, Web3 encompasses a wide range of applications and technologies:</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>DeFi Protocols:</strong> Lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional banks</li>\r\n        <li><strong>NFTs:</strong> Digital ownership of art, music, and other creative works</li>\r\n        <li><strong>DAOs:</strong> Decentralized autonomous organizations for collective decision-making</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Metaverse:</strong> Virtual worlds and digital experiences</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Web3 Social:</strong> Social networks where users control their data</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Challenges and Limitations</h2>\r\n      <p>Despite its potential, Web3 faces several significant challenges:</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Current blockchains struggle with high transaction volumes</li>\r\n        <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Complex interfaces and technical barriers</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Regulatory Uncertainty:</strong> Unclear legal frameworks in many jurisdictions</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Environmental Concerns:</strong> High energy consumption of some consensus mechanisms</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Smart contract vulnerabilities and user error risks</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n\r\n      <h2>The Future of Web3</h2>\r\n      <p>Looking ahead, several trends are shaping the future of Web3:</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Layer 2 Solutions:</strong> Scaling solutions to improve transaction speed and reduce costs</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Zero-Knowledge Proofs:</strong> Privacy-preserving technologies for confidential transactions</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Cross-Chain Interoperability:</strong> Seamless communication between different blockchains</li>\r\n        <li><strong>AI Integration:</strong> Artificial intelligence enhancing Web3 applications</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Regulatory Clarity:</strong> Clearer legal frameworks enabling mainstream adoption</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Getting Started with Web3</h2>\r\n      <p>For those interested in exploring Web3, here are some practical steps:</p>\r\n      <ol>\r\n        <li>Set up a digital wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)</li>\r\n        <li>Explore DeFi protocols with small amounts</li>\r\n        <li>Join DAOs and participate in governance</li>\r\n        <li>Create or collect NFTs</li>\r\n        <li>Learn about different blockchain networks</li>\r\n      </ol>\r\n\r\n      <p>The evolution of Web3 is still ongoing, and we're likely only seeing the beginning of its potential. As technology continues to advance and user adoption grows, Web3 promises to fundamentally reshape how we interact with the digital world, putting power back in the hands of users and creating new possibilities for innovation and collaboration.</p>\r\n    `,\r\n    tags: [\"Web3\", \"Evolution\", \"Blockchain\", \"History\", \"Future\"],\r\n    thumbnail: \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1639322537504-6427a16b0a28?w=400&h=250&fit=crop&crop=center\"\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n\r\nexport const getBlogBySlug = (slug) => {\r\n  return blogData.find(blog => blog.slug === slug);\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const getRecentBlogs = (excludeId = null, limit = 5) => {\r\n  return blogData\r\n    .filter(blog => blog.id !== excludeId)\r\n    .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.date) -
